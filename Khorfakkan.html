    Khorfakkan is an excellent spot for a daycation. On Sharjah's east coast, this peaceful enclave is popular 
    for its crystal clear sea, golden beach, and craggy mountains that invite adventure.We are pleased to announce
    that DPS Dubai will be partnering up with Odyessey Outings to host a camping field trip to Khor Fakkan Beach and
    Mountains in Sharjah for grade 8.

    The trip will be for 5 days from 20th to 25th July, 2023. Students will be staying at Royal Al Aqah Beach Hotel. 
    Students must pay an amount of AED 800 for the hotel stay and meals. Students must give their name to their class 
    teacher or the nearest student council representative. The last day to pay is 25th June, 2023 through RFID or the
